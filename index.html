            <p class="bio-text">My name is Brandon Williams and I am an aspiring Full Stack web developer. My overall
                goal, is always to produce work that both meets an exceeds
                what a client is looking for. I have over 7 years of education in the areas of I.T. Networking and
                Security, and have been exposed to, and learning coding
                and web development since my days in middle school. In the late days of 2019, I decided it was time for
                a change. Having felt stuck in a rut for quite some time,
                and feeling less than satisfied with where my life seemed to be heading, I decided to shift all of my
                focus into learning Full Stack web development, where I felt
                I would have the best chance at finding satisfaction, and letting my creative talents truly come to the
                surface. To this end after much searching, I enrolled in the
                University of Wisconsin Coding Bootcamp, and with renewed passion and enthusiasm started down the path
                of yet another exciting adventure in life.
                When I am not coding, or in the process of delving into learning about a new and interesting topic, I
                can be found sitting at my piano, reading a book, or by his royal decree, (I just pay the rent)
                showering attention
                and the more than occasional belly rub on my cat Peanut.
